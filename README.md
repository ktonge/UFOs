# UFOs
## Overview 
For this weeks challenge we were given the task of displaying UFO sighting data in a friendly and searchable way using Javascript and HTML. I created a table that displays the data based on a the input of one or more search terms (date, city, state, country, shape).  The table works by determining if the typed search element is different from the filtered data, if it is, it updates itself to match the new search criteria.  Criteria must be lowercase for the site to function.  

## The Website
The website opens to an unfiltered view of the data in a table.  Once I added the search criteria for the state of California (ca), and the shape triangle, I was left with the following results.

## Future Improvements

I would have preferred to do the country and the states as a drop down list, a main drawback of the data is that you can only search it in lowercase, which could be difficult to initial users.  It would also be helpful to make the site interactive and add a form at the bottom, or separate contact page where folks could submit their own sightings.
